# CunningDJ UUID generator
This is a single page site I made for fun, that generates 50-character uuid's for you.

## Dependencies
* NodeJS
* npm (comes with Node install)

## Instructions
1. Git clone the repo
2. In the command line: 
    * Type `npm install` in the home directory.  This will install the server dependencies seen in the `package.json` file.
    * Type `node src/server.js`
3. As you can see from the command line logging, and in `src/config.json`, this serves on `http://localhost:8686i`.  Go to that address on your browser.

That's it!

## Explanation
This was primarily a project for me to keep fresh with a few skills, and to experiment with some RNG-based API elements.  I hope you enjoy it.
